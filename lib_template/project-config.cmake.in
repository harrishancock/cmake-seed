# This file expects to be configured via the configure_package_config_file
# function of the CMakePackageConfigHelpers module. The PROJECT_NAME will be
# used as the name of the package, and used in the identifiers for variables
# set by this script. For a project LibTurd, the following variables would be
# set:
#
# LIBTURD_INCLUDE_DIRS
# LIBTURD_LIBRARIES
#
# Note the conversion to uppercase. This is deliberate, because it's how I
# think it should be.
#
# The variables INCLUDE_DIR and TARGET must be set before configuring this
# file.

# Required by CMakePackageConfigHelpers
